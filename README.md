# ExApp

This project is just my playground project. It was created using this command:

```bash
mix phx.new ex_app --no-ecto --no-webpack
```

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
